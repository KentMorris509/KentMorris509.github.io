                I am currently entering as a Systems Engineer Intern at G2 Ops. I will be working on MBSE for Cyber Security Systems for the Department of Defense.
                This will involve having a complex understanding of how multiple disciplines function together and a complex understanding of how to build
                understandable and efficient models to find cyber risk amongst servers, networks, and software applications. I am most excited to start working on incorporating
                AI tools into building new and innovative model based systems to help government clients.

               <p>
                I love to travel to new places and be immersed in the outdoors. I enjoy playing golf, basketball, hiking, camping, and working out in my free time. I'm a strong fan of my Bay Area sports teams in the Warriors, A's, and Niners.

              <h3>Chess Board Game</h3>
              <p>
              Project Motivation: The Motivation for this project was out of the interest to make a movable GUI application of a beloved game that I like to play. This was
              also interesting because in order to build a chess game you need to utilize the skills of OOP and understanding all the use cases
              that are possible in the game. Making a chess engine playable game seemed like a awesome opportunity to display my programming skills and demonstrate
              a deep knowledge and understanding in the basic fundamentals of test-driven development. I also wanted to make a project that used
              a movable inteface that is easy for the user to use and understand. I love the game of chess and I believe the project displays a 
              an accurate and user friendly experience of the actual game.
              </p>
              <p>
              Functional Requirements: the requirements of the game were to make the game user friendly with a dragable game board that restricts illegal movement and 
              highlights valid moves that the user can make. The project also plays by the exact rules of chess with check rules, end pond rules, and casteling. To make
              the user experience seemless we also allow a valid move guide to the user that highlights the valid locations you can move a piece when you click on it. This 
              also comes with a message display tab at the bottom of the project to show piece locations methods, turn status, and invalid move warnings.
              Having all these requirements is important to make sure that the game is functional and user-friendly.
              </p>
              <p>
              Project Design: The design of the project was followed using abstract classes and interfaces for the board and individual pieces that are connected to a GUI interface
              as the back end logic. Then separate classes for each piece type with the valid moves that they can make connected to a validmove() method that checks the board for all 
              valid locations that are then highlighted to the user for where they can move. Then under our board class we have all the internal board logic of a grid of where a piece can move
              as well as the current position. We decided to write the program in java and use swift JPanel to make the GUI board for the project. We came up with this project structure as a team
              since we believed separating the backend logic from the GUI and inheriting each piece from a Piece class and Location Class would allow us to reuse code and be very efficient. By separating our
              backend logic we were able to adapt the GUI and fit it into our parameter so that it would work with any GUI framwork used as long as it had the valid parameters. I believe
              due to this the documentation is easy to understand and track all our methods.
              </p>
              <p>
              Implementation: I was responsible for building the GUI to be connected to our background knowledge. This included creating a button mapping grid for the board that included 
              keyboard listeners for a click grabbing a pieces location and then listening for a second click to parse the piece location and pass to our board movepiece() method. In doing 
              so I also implemented the GUI highlighting all valid movements a piece could go by using the current location of the clicked on piece and grabbing all the valid positions then looping
              through each piece and passing them through our isValid() method to only highlight valid moves. For the GUI design it required me to make a grid using JPanel and add this functionality to 
              each panel of the board as well as address the correct Piece png images given the color and type specified in our board implementation. I was also responsible for our initial board 
              and main method structure of using a 8x8 board of Piece types to keep track of all pieces currently on the board. I then started our movePiece() method implementation to move a single 
              piece given input and built it to be passed to our Piece logic for a king, queen, rook, etc, later in the project.
